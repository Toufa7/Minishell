Realizing a simplified version of the shell program

# Built-in Functions

A builtin (or builtin command, or shell builtin) is a command or function that is part of the shell itself.
The command is "built-in" to the shell program â€” no external program is necessary to run the command, and a new process does not need to be created.

# Environment list

Each element of the list consists of a name and an associated value

Env Variables are created with EXPORT 


# Signals

Simply a signal is a notification to a process that an event has occured (Interprocess Communication (IPC))

So a signal is said to be generated by some event once it generated it delivered to a process

Each signal has a unique small integer starting form 1.

The uses of signals :

    -   The hardware detect a fault condition that was notified to the kernel
            Example :   - Dividing by 0
                        - Seg Fault
    -   The user typed a special char the generate signals 
            Example :   - $<><>

Categories of signals :

    -   Standard of traditional signals :   which are used by the kernel to notify processes or events (1 -> 31)

    -   Realtime signals :  which are used by the kernel to notify processes or events (1 -> 31)



Walkthrough Signal to Process :

    -   


Process answers to a signal :

-   Ignored : The process never even knows that it occurred

-   Terminated or Killed : Simply tell a process to terminate using exit()

-   Default action should occur

-   Singal Handler 

Ctrl-C displays a new prompt on a new line.
Ctrl-D exits the shell , PS : The line should be empty
Ctrl-\ does nothing.

The kernel is the essential center of a computer operating system (OS). It is the core that provides basic services for all other parts of the OS. It is the main layer between the OS and hardware, and it helps with process and memory management, file systems, device control and networking.
